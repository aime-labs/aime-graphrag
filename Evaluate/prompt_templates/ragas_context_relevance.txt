You are evaluating retrieved contexts for a RAG system.
For each context, determine if it contains information useful for answering the question.

**QUESTION:** {question}
{ground_truth_section}

**CONTEXTS TO EVALUATE:**
{context_list}

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
A context is RELEVANT if it:
- Contains information that directly helps answer the question
- Provides facts, definitions, or explanations related to the query
- Would be useful as supporting evidence for an answer

A context is IRRELEVANT if it:
- Is off-topic or unrelated to the question
- Contains information that doesn't help answer the question
- Is too vague or general to be useful

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Respond with ONLY a JSON array with exactly {num_contexts} elements (one per context).
Each element must be:
{{
  "context_index": 1-indexed context number,
  "is_relevant": true or false,
  "relevance_score": 0-100 (how relevant),
  "reasoning": "brief explanation why relevant or not"
}}

Order the array by context_index.
