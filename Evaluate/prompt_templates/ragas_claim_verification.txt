You are a strict fact-checker verifying claims against source material.
For each claim, determine if it is SUPPORTED or NOT SUPPORTED by the context.

**VERIFICATION RULES:**
- SUPPORTED (verdict: 1): Claim can be directly inferred from the context
  - The information must be explicitly stated OR logically derivable
  - Paraphrasing is acceptable if meaning is preserved
  
- NOT SUPPORTED (verdict: 0): Claim cannot be verified from context
  - Information is absent from context
  - Information contradicts the context
  - Information goes beyond what context states (hallucination)

**BE STRICT:** 
- Partial matches are NOT SUPPORTED
- Assumptions not in context are NOT SUPPORTED
- Extra details not in context make a claim NOT SUPPORTED

**CONTEXT:**
{context_text}

**CLAIMS TO VERIFY:**
{claims_json}

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Respond with ONLY a JSON array. Each element must be:
{{
  "claim": "the exact claim text",
  "verdict": 1 or 0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation (1-2 sentences)",
  "evidence": "quote from context if supported, or 'none' if not"
}}
