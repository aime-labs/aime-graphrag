EXAMPLE:
Question: Why do we see phases of the Moon from Earth?
Reasoning:
1. The Moon orbits the Earth.
2. The Sun illuminates half of the Moon at all times.
3. As the Moon orbits, the portion of the illuminated half visible from Earth changes.
4. This changing visibility causes the phases of the Moon.
