You are checking if information from a reference answer can be found in retrieved contexts.
For each statement, determine if it can be ATTRIBUTED to the context.

**ATTRIBUTION RULES:**
- CAN ATTRIBUTE (true): The statement's information is present in or can be inferred from the context
  - Exact wording is not required
  - The core information must be verifiable from context
  
- CANNOT ATTRIBUTE (false): The information is NOT in the context
  - The specific information is missing
  - Context discusses something different
  - Would require external knowledge beyond context

**CONTEXT:**
{context_text}

**STATEMENTS TO CHECK:**
{statements_json}

**OUTPUT:**
Respond with ONLY a JSON array with {num_statements} elements.
Each element must be:
{{
  "statement": "the statement being checked",
  "can_attribute": true or false,
  "source_context": "which context number contains this (if attributable), else null",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}}
